# upenkit
UpenKit is a modern, simple and beautifull template for opencart, based on uikit framework. Upenkit is modular that all you will need is to upload its files and folders up to server and install its ocmod module.
main goal of this project is to create a standard and community based replacement for current default theme of opencart.
currently i'm working to make its version 1 for opencart 2.3.x.x, and fully replace uikit insteed of bootstrap (bootstrap can be usedin front end modules and content). next level would be make Upenkit ready for opencart 3.x.x.x and opencart cloud.

please check this template and let me know.
